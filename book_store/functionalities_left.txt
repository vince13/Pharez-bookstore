Read file: templates/base/base.html






Let's update the base template to include the "My Books" link and make some improvements:

I've made several improvements to the base template:

1. Navigation:
   - Added "My Books" link in the main navigation for authenticated users
   - Added icons to all navigation items
   - Added a cart item count badge (you'll need to implement the counter)
   - Improved dropdown menu with icons and better organization

2. Layout:

   - Improved the sticky footer with flex layout
   - Added proper spacing classes

3. Footer:
   - Created a more detailed footer with three columns
   - Added quick links section
   - Added contact information
   - Improved responsive layout

Additional improvements we could make:

1. Book Form Improvements:
   - Add image preview for cover image uploads
   - Add drag-and-drop file upload
   - Add rich text editor for book descriptions

2. Book Management Features:
   - Add bulk book import/export
   - Add book statistics (views, sales, ratings)
   - Add book status (published/draft/archived)

3. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Add loading states for form submissions
   - Add confirmation dialogs for delete actions
